Start
Create a new 	Scanner to read userâ€™s input
Print and enter the height of the First Person
Read the user input for the First Person
Print and enter the height of the Second Person
Read the user input for the First Person
Compare the height of the First Person and Second Person
Print out the result of the height comparison
