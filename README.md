Write a program that takes, as input, a fully parenthesized, arithmetic expression and converts it to a
binary expression tree. Your program should display the tree in some way and also print the value
associated with the root. For an additional challenge, allow for the leaves to store variables of the form
x1, x2, x3, and so on, which are initially 0 and which can be updated interactively by your program,
with the corresponding update in the printed value of the root of the expression tree. Display the
corresponding prefix and postfix notation.
